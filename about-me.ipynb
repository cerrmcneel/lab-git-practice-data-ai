I’m excited to learn because I am interested in Data Science and Machine Learning to better apply my knowlege from experience in fields outside of computer science to solve problems using data-driven approaches.As the barrier to entry to data science and machine learning lowers, I want to apply these skills to fields that in the past were demed too expensive to justify the cost.. A fun fact about me is: I can ride a unicycle. My goal for this course is to me more proficient in Python and to reinforce my understanding of data science and machine learning concepts that I have learned on other platforms such as Data Camp and Coursera..\n"
